# Food Segmentation using U-Net
---
During this project I have created a code to segment food present in a tray coming from [Tray Food Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thezaza102/tray-food-segmentation).  More precisely, the original U-Net Xception style model was replicated in `Python` by using `Keras`.
